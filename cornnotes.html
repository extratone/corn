Dave,
<div><br/></div><div>We spoke on Friday about shooting for our film at the Diner. Essentially, we just need shots at night, without any customers.  We have a limited budget but we will compensate any employee(s) that are required to be present and we'd also like to give you something for the use of the building. At most, we'll need 2 hours, but it should be significantly less.</div><div><br/></div><div>In general, I need to schedule at least two weeks in advance, and our deadline is the end of May, so the most convenient time/day in that range for you is good for us.</div><div><br/></div><div><br/></div><div><br/></div><div>Thanks!</div><div>David Blue</div><div>david@drywall.ws</div></span>

The Pitch</b></div><div>INTERCUTS between Tucker as he meets with the Monsanto BOARD OF DIRECTORS, and Isaac as he meets with his family.</div><div>-Tucker is introduced to the board by THE CEO before he presents (for approval) their three step plan for Amish cultural eradication.</div><div>-Over dinner with his MOTHER, FATHER, and Gabriela, Isaac explains his plan to use Tucker's interest to build the strength of the Amish, and defends his &quot;temporary&quot; (personal) rejection of the Amish philosophy as a &quot;necessary evil&quot; to ensure their survival.  They question him, he grows defensive and leaves the table.</div><div><br/></div><div><b>6. Sleeping in Church</b></div><div>-JOSEPH BOWES is awakened from his nap in the Amish church by HIS NIECE, who informs him of Isaac's endeavors. Tucker's name is mentioned. (Heard from Gabriela in &quot;first service.&quot;)</div><div><br/></div><div><b>7.

-Don encounters one YOUNG AMISH MAN who describes Bowes as &quot;dishonest&quot; and &quot;sleazy.&quot; </div><div>-Tucker and Isaac stroll through the community discussing the details of their arrangement.  Don happens upon them, questions them, and casually inquires as to why they're in the community, as neither appears Amish.</div><div><br/></div><div><b>11. The Reckoning</b></div><div>-Tucker is pulled over by a POLICE OFFICER while giving Isaac a ride to town. He intentionally shits himself, calculating the cost of new pants to be lower than the fine, and excuses his speeding as dire need for the toilet.

Free Range</b></div><div>-Tucker and Isaac eat dinner at Isaac's house, discussing Isaac's hopes for Amish independence, Tucker's predictions on the future of Amish-English cooperation, and the night of March 23rd.

He shoots, but is made teary-eyed and dizzy by the unengineered (GMO-free) food and misses. Isaac escapes.</div><div><br/></div><div><b>15. The Tucker Manifesto</b></div><div><b>-</b>Tucker arrives at the CPA sick and vomiting. He produces a jug of RoundUp and injects it in his arm with a needle, curing him in seconds. Drake updates him on the progress of phase 2 and mentions the staff's dangerously low morale, prompting Tucker to deliver a long speech on the necessity of Amish eradication, leaving most of the crowd confused.</div><div>-After Tucker is done, Drake rallies the agents and equips them with identity-programming headgear.  </div><div>-They proceed on foot to their assigned locations in the Amish community.</div><div><b><br/></b></div><div><b>16.

The Phone Call</b></div><div>Tucker calls Isaac and confesses his actions against the Amish and the true motivation behind them. Isaac records the call and attempts to blackmail Tucker, but he struggles with the voice recorder for several minutes (which plays only static and the occasional sound of clothes rubbing on the microphone,) before eventually giving up. His phone is jammed shortly afterwards by the FBI, ending the call.</div><div><br/></div><div><b>20.

<div>-A skyscraper is moved in on a vehicle resembling the saturn V rocket transporter into a secluded amish community. Afterwards, a torrent of fleet cars drive down the Amish streets right into the skyscraper.  The Amish feel as if an alien mothership has landed. Apocalyptic.<br/>
-After Tucker's speech, a scene where Drake is programming the college kids.</div><div>-&quot;They forget their childhood; they're a whole new human now, and they have nothing but contempt for the Amish.&quot;</div><div>-After they are programmed, they &quot;just walk out and start terrorizing the Amish community&quot; with the pace of a businessman walking through the mall toward the Fendi store.</div><div>-The salad colanders will remain on their heads.</div><div>-Salad colanders have RAM chips taped to them.</div><div>-50s scifi</div><div>-A really large antenna on the salad colander as well</div><div>-Car CB radio antenna</div><div>-Actors will be paid to walk through downtown Columbia wearing these accessories. (in the film, they are walking through downtown towards the amish community.)</div><div>-When the CPA agents actually ARRIVE in the Amish community &quot;some real shit&quot; happens. &quot;Scene straight out of an exploitation film.&quot;</div><div>&quot;Some little Amish person is walking along when they suddenly get pushed down by colander agents.&quot;</div><div>&quot;[The agents] whip out their smartphones and open up the flashlight app.&quot;</div><div>&quot;They're just flashing this light and the Amish don't know what this is&quot; ....they're screaming</div><div>They're kicked around before having their brains fried by the smartphones.</div><div>On the screen, there's an app that has a slider beneath text that says &quot;MICROWAVE EMISSIONS&quot; On screen, we see an agent slide the slider all the way to the right, through a zone that says &quot;LETHAL.&quot; Afterwards, the effect of a watermelon exploding (as the individual's head.)</div><div>-&quot;A giant projector screen with TED talks&quot; (to terrify the Amish.) Projects on to their farmhouse (also playing YouTube videos) while agents spraypaint raw code on farmhouse/something. <b>where does the code come from? rusk should pick it</b></div><div><b>-</b>Drake could be recruiting these people from college campuses.</div><div>-The CPA agents pour cough syrup into a cup and mix in sprinkles of pills, then force feed it to an Amish person.</div><div>&quot;Some old amish person having an existential crises right there.&quot;</div><div>-5 minutes of Amish horror</div><div>-&quot;More tormenting than killing.&quot;</div><div>-What's Agent Hawkins going to do about this?</div><div>-He'd have to arrive on scene in his car...it terrifies them too.</div><div>-He arrives and starts defending them...calls for backup but the FBI has abandoned him.</div><div>-He's got a pistol and 2 magazines of ammo, one shotgun in the trunk of his car.</div><div>-In his defense of the Amish, given his limited ammo supply, he has to fist fight groups of CPA agents, injecting elements of a traditional military thriller into the movie. The Bourne Movies.</div><div>-But then he stumbles upon AN ARSENAL of weapons somehow in this amish community.</div><div>-Before this....a scene where he is backed into a corner in a barn with a bunch of amish people behind him, they're terrified. But somehow he gets out of this. &quot;Goes akimbo&quot; *looks over and sees the arsenal mentioned above* he's like &quot;alright&quot; and mows them down.</div><div>-The Amish survive this &quot;battle&quot; but they are severely weakened. </div><div>-So this battle is separate from &quot;the big finale&quot; battle.</div><div>-What happens in between?</div><div>-Brent suggests that they blend together.</div><div>-Note that above, the CPA agents don't have guns, so agent hawkins is essentially just slaughtering them.</div><div>-&quot;one of them has just been brutally murdered. His intestines have been taking out of his stomach and used to hang him in the middle of a generator.&quot;</div><div>-Brent suggests that we see Isaac change sort of, and then disappear for a bit in the film, then &quot;Isaac Cleans out the CPA&quot;</div><div>-&quot;the scene right after Tucker shoots at Isaac, we see him change&quot;</div><div>-so after tucker shoots at isaac, he goes back to the CPA, shoots up roundup to recover from the GMO-free food, delivers his crazy long speech and that speech is just SO FUCKING LONG that is really just SEEMS Isaac has been gone for a long time</div><div>and then the colander heads come in...we see the 10 minutes or whatever of amish destruction</div><div>And then the CPA base clean out.....and Isaac is revealed to be responsible for it right at the end</div><div>&quot;Scene ?5 comes later, everything after Scene?5 is Isaac's rage&quot;</div><div>-Idea for the huge final battle between Tucker and Isaac: tucker is in a combine, coming at Isaac with the reel turning but somehow the combine comes to an abrupt halt, Tucker flies out of the windshield. We're led to believe by the camera angle that he's going to fall into the reel of his own combine but actually just falls on a pitchfork that Isaac is holding and that is where he dies. Even if the combine isn't involved, Tucker should die by falling on a pitchfork.</div><div>-Brent proposes a dead leaves- like gun battle between tucker and Issac.</div><div>-Don is in the way of Isaac and he ends up dying...his death is not justified to the audience. Dies out of focus.  Only in the frame/focus enough for you to realize who it is. &quot;The way the shot is done, you're forced to not care about Don's death.&quot;  We never see him again.</div><div>-DON COULD DIE IN THE MIDDLE OF THE TUCKER-ISAAC FIGHT</div><div><br/></div><div>&quot;The end of the movie.....as Isaac kills the last CPA agent, he turns around to face his people, who he has been protecting, and they are disgusted by him.&quot; Isaac stands in confusion for a second before pointing a gun at Gabriela (who's standing in the crowd,) and it immediately cuts to black. (We don't hear any gunshots or anything)</div></span>

And that's just it.  You're my family, I love you.  It enrages me to see you wither away without any ambition.  Living in the world of the English, (and it is a completely different world,) I have discovered how absolutely powerful their ambition is.  It is the foundation..the <i>meaning</i> even of their lives, and the only protection against their ambition is an ambition of your own.  You may not feel threatened by them now...but the free land is disappearing, Gabriela, and the buffer between our conflicting societies will disappear with it.<br/>

I see the skepticism on your faces, my friends.  I know you begin to doubt, and why not?  These acts we commit..this violence, what is it for?  I haven't made it clear, have I?  Have I not communicated adequately the tremendous importance of this task we have before us?
<div><br/></div><div>This species we are part of...this community.  Long has it struggled to be free of its doubters.  We've faced critics and questioners and leeches and bygone lost souls.  There have been campaigns of violence against our core sort, cultural pillaging, and loose-mouthed &quot;thinkers&quot; with endless empty points to make and lightweight citizens to sway.</div><div><br/></div><div><br/></div><div>We have, as a family, faced this all for hundreds of years.  Of course, we carry the conflicts and privileges of our fathers in our bones if not in our worldly stature. And what have we made with this life?  We've created technical marvels, reduced the average suffering of the species significantly, and constructed a safe, assured, and well-established system of behaviors and actions.  We know, for instance, what a 6 year old of a specific class and race should say, how it should dress, and how it should interpret and rationalize the inputs it's faced with in daily life.<br/></div><div><br/></div><div>Consider for a moment the human factor in all of this progression.  Think about the millions of devoted workers who've spent their lives furthering the family's quality of life.  Hold their faces in your mind.  Now compile them into one manifestation, one body.  Now imagine a dangerous and radical faction that would reject the standards upon which this worker's precious life has spent in toil to fulfill. </div><div><br/></div><div>Can you imagine, my friends, a parent that would claim to love its child, yet discourage their education?</div><div><br/></div><div>Can you imagine a group of &quot;humans&quot; that would reject the miracle of modern hygiene and cling to a medieval regimen of <i>annual</i> bathing? </div><div><br/></div><div>Can you imagine such a prehistoric, unevolved <i>thing</i> calling itself one of us...and yet refusing the benefits of our enlightening communication apparatus?  The goal we have worked so long and so hard to achieve.</div><div><br/></div><div>I cannot imagine such an abomination, and yet I must face it daily.  They call themselves &quot;Amish,&quot; and they and their ideals are the last true threat to the unity of humanity.</div><div><br/></div><div>Arrogance.  I have seen none like this.  Their primitive communities are bound with it.  <i>How dare they</i> reject what we have built!  What right do they have to their own cultist practices?!  It is not natural to be so separate; it is not natural to rejoice in such isolation.</div><div><br/></div><div><br/></div><div><br/></div><div>I do not fret, however, as I know they will soon be gone.  I know because I see genuine morality in your faces.  You are all just creatures, and the just will always prevail.</div><div><br/></div><div>We must work, however, to keep ourselves on task.  We cannot stray.  What a truly worthy motivation though, the fate of all mankind!</div><div><br/></div><div><br/></div><div><br/></div><div><br/></div><div><br/></div><div>--</div><div><br/></div><div><br/></div><div>Look around you - tell me what you see. This. All of this. (arm sweeps the room.)</div><div><br/></div><div>(pause)</div><div><br/></div><div>This is the product of man's mind.  The thinking men - the real men - THEY are the ones that built this world for you. </div><div><br/></div><div>Some of you can count yourselves among them.  Others...not so much. But we all work for them. We all must trust them, or look reality in the face and turn to savages again.</div><div><br/></div><div>These men stand at the head of the pack, shining bright, illuminating what's to come like the headlight of a train locomotive. </div><div><br/></div><div>I may not be one of them, but my job - here - is to speak for them.</div><div><br/></div><div>(pointing)</div><div><br/></div><div>And for you, they have a directive:</div><div><br/></div><div>First, stay young! Stay focused.</div><div><br/></div><div>Our species is but one small hesitation away from taking its biggest step. By far, its biggest step. Our job is to remove that last hesitation.  Each one of you will bear witness to a whole new renaissance of thought.  And you should feel privileged!  </div><div><br/></div><div>We're about to evolve; we're about to transcend ourselves.  You are - quite literally - the luckiest people who've ever lived. </div></span>

1.     Tucker attempts to gain Isaac's trust at the Diner.
<div>2.     Tucker drives away from Diner, opening credits play.</div><div>3.     Isaac talks to his sister, Gabriela about the encounter with Tucker</div><div>4.     The next day, Tucker arrives at the CPA safehouse, inquires about the status of the cyber aspect of the operation from Drake (who is introduced here.)  Drake informs Tucker that the agents planning the operation to destroy physical records of the Amish had not given him an estimated completion time.  Tucker kills one of the agents (Phil Mallard) to demonstrate his seriousness in the operation to both the other agents and the audience.</div><div>5.     Tucker receives a call from Monsanto and immediately takes Mallard's Mercury Mariner to Monsanto headquarters in St. Louis for a meeting. In this meeting, the order to commence all aspects of the operation is given, and it's shown how scared all of Tucker's superiors are of him...Tucker is more himself in the boardroom than anywhere else in the movie...but it's made clear that he's still acting somewhat.  The plan for Amish eradication is being UNVEILED here.</div><div>6.     As Tucker is visiting Monsanto, Isaac visits his family for the first time in years.  Around the dinner table, Isaac's complete alienation from his family is shown.  They obviously can't even communicate in the &quot;same language&quot; as Isaac is speaking.  (He's interested in Amish rights and expansion, but his family can only see what is immediately in front of them.)</div><div>7.     That night, Tucker calls Isaac and offers reassurances and helps repair the emotional damage that Isaac suffers when he realizes the differences he has with his family.</div><div>8.     The next day, Isaac tells Gabriela the great news, and gets her a little excited too.  The word gets to Joseph Bowes.</div><div>9.     Joseph Bowes sets off to warn Isaac about Tucker out of guilt, but Tucker intercepts and kills him with his special seed-gun thing on his way to Isaac.</div><div>10.  The next day, Don Hawkins arrives on the scene of Bowes' murder...which is taped off. (USE BRENT'S DANGER TAPE). Does some Gibbs shit...witty, cynical remarks from an ex-special forces, alcoholic federal agent. </div><div>11.  That night...in a motel room, Don examines a posterboard (makes no real sense, but has something to allude to amish hatecrimes, has pins and string, think of Lundy's trinity board but without any order whatsoever.) </div><div>-Don is also researching on a laptop</div><div>-At some point, <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20120621182946AAeGHEq">this yahoo answers page</a> comes up, Don ponders it (it's on his face.)</div><div>-Possibly a shot of Don smoking outside the motel room at night</div><div>12.  (The next day) Don questions members of the Amish community about the murder.  TUCKER and ISAAC are on a walk through the community and DON stops them to ask questions.  ISAAC does most of the talking....but DON now knows TUCKER's name.</div><div><b>SHITCOP SCENE HERE (taking isacc somewhere, calls monsanto after dropping isaac off)</b></div><div>13.  On the drive from the Amish community back to the CPA base, TUCKER calls someone at Monsanto and briefs them on DON's activities...he's figuring out things he shouldn't...getting a little too close</div><div>14.  (A scene that helps us get to know TUCKER more as the protagonist)  (<b>NEEDS TO BE DONE)</b> <i>THE DINNER SCENE</i></div><div>15.  Don gets a call from his boss at the FBI...he explains that the investigation is being halted...the case is being closed and declared an agricultural accident.  Don is ordered to cease the investigation altogether, but he protests.  </div><div>&quot;This is a little over your head, buddy.&quot;</div><div>&quot;We both know politics aren't your forte man.&quot; </div><div>The last thing the FBI boss says is &quot;When was the last time you drank?&quot;  Don answers &quot;Uh...maybe three weeks ago,&quot; and the FBI boss abruptly ends the call. (Later, the audio from this call is used as a reason to fire Don from the FBI.)</div><div>16.  At Isaac's house....Tucker and Isaac are at his coffee table discussing the night of the murder (need to determine a date,) Tucker begins the conversation saying he was speaking at AgCon 1998, lots of dialogue occurs, Tucker eventually screws up and says that he was with his kids.  Isaac is like &quot;Wait...&quot; with a slightly puzzled look..Tucker IMMEDIATELY pulls out his 9mm saying something like &quot;goddamn it&quot; or &quot;shit&quot; and fires a shot that actually misses Isaac.  He misses because the Amish (non-GMO) food upsets his system and blurs his vision.  Tucker runs around the house looking for Isaac but is too sick...has to retreat...leaves the house and drives haphazardly away.</div><div>17.  Tucker goes back to the CPA, he's sick, vomiting everywhere.  Everyone is there but they're too fucking scared of him to help, they just watch.  He walks to a closet or some sort of storage area and pulls out a jug of roundup.  Preps a needle / IV thing and injects it into his arm.  Immediately starts feeling better. Drake is there.  After a few seconds of silence as Tucker feels the roundup in his body, Drake says something like &quot;I've got something that'll make you feel better&quot; and he types &quot;Amish&quot; into google, the &quot;0 results found&quot; page pops up.</div><div><br/></div><div>Then manually types in the URL to the Amish wikipedia page and the error 404 message appears.</div><div><br/></div><div style="text-align: justify;">Drake then mentions that some of the CPA agents are getting upset about what they're about to do...morale is low....Tucker eventually launches into his big speech. (see: <b>Scene?4</b>) </div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br/></div><div style="text-align: justify;">The agents are mostly confused but they rally and cheer because they know that's what they're supposed to do in this situation.</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br/></div><div style="text-align: justify;">18.  (continuous) - Drake screetches.  The gathering/audience of CPA employees is shuttled towards Drake, *they have no independent thought*  Drake places salad colanders on each of their heads.  Salad colanders will have RAM chips taped to them and a large antenna (CB radio antenna).  </div><div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="text-align: center;">After the salad colanders are placed on their heads, the CPA employees move single file out of the CPA base. We then see them walk out on foot.  Various shots of different actors walking in various locations with the salad colander on their heads, accompanied by cinematic building music.</span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="text-align: center;"><br/></span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="text-align: center;">19.  &quot;what are they going to do when they get to the amish&quot; <i>10 minute of Amish exploitation/horror</i></span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="text-align: center;">-An old Amish lady is shoved to the ground by the colander agents as she walks through the amish community.</span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="text-align: center;">-CPA agents use the LEDs on their iPhones to terrify a group of Amish children.</span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="text-align: center;">-An amish man in his 40s is held on the ground while an iPhone is placed next to his head. On the screen, text reads &quot;MICROWAVE EMISSIONS,&quot; the agent holding the phone advances the slider (which is beneath it) to the far most right position through a red section labeled &quot;LETHAL.&quot; A whirring/spooling up noise is heard and his head explodes.</span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="text-align: center;">-A projector plays a TED talk on an Amish farmhouse, children run away in horror.</span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="text-align: center;">-Another projector plays a Ray William Johnson video on one side of a barn, while raw code is spraypainted on another.</span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="text-align: center;">-Don Hawkins arrives and begins firing on the attacking CPA agents with his pistol. He calls the FBI for backup but they have abandoned him. He moves through the &quot;battlefield,&quot; (Amish are being terrorized all over the area,) aimlessly shooting agents. He comes upon a group of Amish cowering in a barn, a large group of CPA agents approaches.  Don picks off the first few with his gun but has to resort to fist fighting them.  In a lull, Don happens to look right and notices AN ARSENAL of modern weapons in this Amish barn.  He simply says &quot;alright,&quot; and begins slaughtering the agents.  He kills every last one, and the Amish survive, but they are severely weakened. </span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="text-align: center;"><br/></span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="text-align: center;">20. <b>Isaac Cleans Out the CPA</b></span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><div style="text-align: -webkit-auto;">-Lights are off in the CPA, we see a silhouette silently killing one agent after another, eventually the lights come on and the entire room is just one bloody / gore mess.  They're all unimportant.  All in cubicles.  It's Isaac doing the killing but we don't know that.</div><div style="text-align: -webkit-auto;">-After the lights come on, there's only one man left, camera zooms in on gore mess for a few seconds, shows the variety of methods Isaac used to kill everyone, then we clearly see Isaac sneaking up behind this terrified / frozen man.  We don't actually see Isaac kill him though.</div><div style="text-align: -webkit-auto;"><br/></div><div style="text-align: -webkit-auto;">These people in the cubicles could be minions of Drake's...this place is almost like a hatchery for compsci majors.</div><div style="text-align: -webkit-auto;"><br/></div><div style="text-align: -webkit-auto;">21. <b>Family Man</b></div><div style="text-align: -webkit-auto;">Don sits in his car in a bloodied shirt in a fast food parking lot.  Blood drips from his hand.  He's crying.  He calls Sally, delivers a heartfelt confession of his sexual frustration.</div><div style="text-align: -webkit-auto;"><br/></div><div style="text-align: -webkit-auto;">22. <b>The Phone Call</b></div><div style="text-align: -webkit-auto;">Tucker and Isaac speak for the first time since Tucker shot at Isaac (over the phone.)  This time, Tucker is himself, enjoying the sunset on a dock at the lake (described but not named in the screenplay) drinking gasoline from a wine glass.  This is the only time he states his real intentions in the movie.  He confesses that he will simply go wherever the money is, he doesn't care who lives or dies, and that the Amish philosophical and cultural opposition to Monsanto was merely an opportunity for him to kill. Isaac reveals to him that he has recorded the conversation, but has difficulty playing it back.  Lots of static is heard, as well as clothes rubbing together.  This part of the scene is strung out for minutes before Isaac gives up.  The FBI then jams his phone.</div><div style="text-align: -webkit-auto;"><br/></div><div style="text-align: -webkit-auto;">23. <b>The Final Battle</b></div><div style="text-align: -webkit-auto;">The last scene</div><div style="text-align: -webkit-auto;">We begin with Isaac's full rage.  He's slaughtering CPA agents in all manner of gruesome ways.</div><div style="text-align: -webkit-auto;">(specific methods to be determined at another time with help from brent)</div><div style="text-align: -webkit-auto;"><br/></div><div style="text-align: -webkit-auto;">The final battle between Tucker and Isaac is legendary.  They shoot hundreds of thousands of bullets at each other but still somehow miss. </div><div style="text-align: -webkit-auto;"><br/></div><div style="text-align: -webkit-auto;">They weave in and out of pockets of CPA agents, Tucker not afraid to kill any one in his way, Isaac killing as many as he can without deviating from his quest to kill Tucker.</div><div style="text-align: -webkit-auto;"><br/></div><div style="text-align: -webkit-auto;">Don Hawkins is in a barn on their route and Isaac kills him as they pass through.  He is only on frame long enough for us to recognize that it <i>is</i> indeed Don, and to see that he dies.  We never see him again.</div><div style="text-align: -webkit-auto;"><br/></div><div style="text-align: -webkit-auto;">Tucker seems to start running away but he's actually making a tactical retreat.....The camera follows Isaac as we see Tucker come around the corner from behind a barn...IN A COMBINE with a grain head and whirling reel.  The camera zooms in on the set of reciprocating knives.  Tucker drives the combine closer and closer, following Isaac as he runs.  (If it's possible, shots of the combine at full speed chasing Isaac would be amazing.)</div><div style="text-align: -webkit-auto;"><br/></div><div style="text-align: -webkit-auto;">Isaac escapes behind a building and Tucker loses him.  He opens the door of the combine, climbs down the first step of the ladder but then jumps off to save time...only to land on a pitchfork that Isaac had darted in with at the last second.  This is how he dies.</div><div style="text-align: -webkit-auto;"><br/></div></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="text-align: center;">Isaac returns to the center of the community and faces one last push by the CPA.</span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="text-align: center;"><br/></span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="text-align: center;">He kills them all mercilessly.  After the last man falls, he looks over the battlefield for a moment before turning to the group of Amish that stand behind him...one of whom is Gabriela.  They all look at him with terror and confusion.  He quickly raises his gun and we immediately CUT TO BLACK before it's to his shoulder.</span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="text-align: center;"><br/></span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="text-align: center;"><br/></span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="text-align: center;">SEE AUDIO NOTES - 2/13/2014 FOR BRENT SCENE IDEAS</span></div></span>

After a second conversation between Isaac and Tucker, Joseph prepares to warn Isaac about Tucker's possible lies, but Tucker kills him before he has the chance in the field next to the big tree.  This is the first Amish man to die at the hand of Tucker's special seed-gun weapon.  Before, Tucker had disguised his Amish kills as hatecrimes.  Joseph, though, is left lying in the field with a huge hole in his torso.  This signifies the beginning of the true all-out war on the Amish waged by Monsanto.</div><div><br/></div><div><strong>Outline</strong></div><div><br/></div><div><strong>Scene 1 - Broadway Diner - Night</strong></div><div>Tucker begins with a really far-fetched metaphor comparing locusts with the amish people's struggle.  &quot;Locusts can carry 3 million times their body weight in grams&quot;</div><div>Isaac and Tucker leave the diner and part ways, Tucker goes to his truck, Isaac goes off camera.  The into credit music starts as Tucker drives back to the secret headquarters in his truck.</div><div><br/></div><div><strong>Scene 2 - CPA (Cyber Purification Agency [pronounced &quot;spa&quot;]) - Night (after drive from Diner)</strong></div><div>Tucker's behavior has completely changed.  Stoic, cold, plotting.  DRAKE is introduced.</div><div>&quot;Plowed him, all we gotta do now is plant the seeds.&quot;</div><div>-Short scene, not too much exposed.</div><div><br/></div><div><strong>Scene 3 - COLUMBIA DOWNTOWN - DAY</strong></div><div>Isaac calls his sister (Gabriela) on his iphone, scene transitions to her home, she answers on wood block phone.</div><div>&quot;What it do&quot;</div><div>Isaac is coming home from out of state...talking to his sis like what it do</div><div><br/></div><div><strong>Scene?1 - CPA - TIME UNKNOWN</strong></div><div>Compsci students return to the CPA and Drake programs them to go back out and terrorize the Amish community</div><div><br/></div><div><strong>Scene?2 - SOMEWHERE IN AMISH LAND - TIME UNDETERMINED</strong></div><div>Isaac is having dinner with his Amish family to showcase how FUCKING DISCONNECTED he is with his family....food is weird though like Korean and taco bell tacos with the taco bell bags still there but the bags are like from 1997.</div><div><br/></div><div><strong>Scene?3 - Monsanto Scene</strong></div><div>After Tucker kills Phil Mallard...he makes a cup of coffee, gets a call.  In the midst of the call, goes to Phil's corpse in the corner, takes his keys, then drives his mercury mariner to st. louis</div><div><br/></div><div><strong>Scene?4 - Tucker's Great Philosophical Speech</strong></div><div>At some point (perhaps some of the men under Tucker are starting to doubt the Amish genocide,) Tucker needs to give a long Galt-like speech detailing the problems with the Amish.  In reality, he doesn't really care enough about &quot;humanity&quot; or social ideas enough to have this opinion, but essentially, he claims that the Amish's refusal to participate in society makes them a dangerous threat to the future of mankind.  He rules them to be outliers...&quot;no individual that is so removed from our well-defined and established system of social hierarchies or one that could sustain such an existence should remain alive.&quot;</div><div><br/></div><div>The Amish are &quot;too extreme&quot; and &quot;arrogant to think that they could just refuse to participate in the agenda of the rest of humanity.&quot;</div><div><br/></div><div>&quot;If these people make the choice to ignore the common goals of the rest of humanity...how can they be human?  If THESE PEOPLE can existence in such a deviate state from the status quo, are they not sick?  Are they not on the same moral ground as a serial killer or a genocidal dictator?  No, <em>these people</em> are not <em>people</em> at all, they're animals.  And what do we do to pests?  Do we let them gnaw at the foundation of the society we have built when a cheap and effective method of their eradication is available?! No!  We eradicate them!&quot;</div><div><br/></div><div><strong>Scene?5 - Isaac Cleans Out the CPA</strong></div><div>-Lights are off in the CPA, we see a silhouette silently killing one agent after another, eventually the lights come on and the entire room is just one bloody / gore mess.  They're all unimportant.  All in cubicles.  It's Isaac doing the killing but we don't know that.</div><div>-After the lights come on, there's only one man left, camera zooms in on gore mess for a few seconds, shows the variety of methods Isaac used to kill everyone, then we clearly see Isaac sneaking up behind this terrified / frozen man.  We don't actually see Isaac kill him though.</div><div><br/></div><div>These people in the cubicles could be minions of Drake's...this place is almost like a hatchery for compsci majors.</div><div><br/></div><div><strong>Scene?6 - Tucker Shit Cop</strong></div><div>Tucker is driving along...perhaps obviously going above the speed limit??? when sirens are heard and &quot;blues + twos&quot; are seen in his rear view mirror.</div><div><br/></div><div>Tucker knows he's going to get a ticket, but he calculates that the cost of replacing his pants and cleaning up the car would be less than that of a speeding ticket, so he shits his pants (literally.)</div><div><br/></div><div>When the officer approaches the window, he can obviously smell the shit and Tucker says something like &quot;I'm sorry officer...I had to use the restroom really bad&quot; and the cop says something like &quot;wow, you <em>did</em> really shit your pants, didn't you?&quot;</div><div><br/></div><div>NEW IDEA</div><div><br/></div><div>Monsanto meeting scene with round table...tucker discussing the operation with monsanto execs...they're scared of him...intercuts with Isaac family scene, also around similarly shaped table, and his family is disconnected.</div><div><br/></div><div><strong>Scene?7 - 30 minute confession</strong></div><div>Voice recorder confession, Isaac gets it from Tucker, but they have to scroll through all the shuffling and waiting because digital voice recorders are shit.</div><div><br/></div><div><strong>Scene?8 - Family Man </strong></div><div>-Doesn't have to necessarily be relevant to the plot, just Don spewing shit over the phone to his wife/kids.</div></span>
