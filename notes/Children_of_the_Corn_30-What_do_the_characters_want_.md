# Children of the Corn 30 - What do the characters want?

**Tucker -** Money & power.  Tucker's utopia: Concrete world, Tucker is supreme leader, computer-brain interfaces.  Everything automated.  All non-whites eradicated and not remembered. Eugenics 

**Isaac -** Amish supremacy through world domination.  Use technology to destroy all technology users, eventually destroying all technology. Amish religious beliefs, Amish attitude toward technology (it corrupts,) but also ambitious with Amish interests. He wants the entire world to be Amish...by force rather than just evangelization.  Isaac is willing to compromise the Amish ethics or morality in order to secure Amish domination,which separates him from the rest of his people. Fundamentally, this is what justifies his law career (potential.)  

Isaac's utopia: completely amish, technology-free world.  CORN

**Don Hawkins -** Children/family, make the world a little safer. Don's Utopia: America, with a little less violence 

**Drake -** Wants to be one with computers...compares himself to computers when he's thinking at night, finds humanity inferior, hates his humanity, would gladly transfer his consciousness to a custom Alienware PC.  Pictures of motherboards in his wallet. 

**Gabriela -** Cliche amish girl.  Wants kids, less violence.  Wants to fuck Jesus...like she would gladly fuck jesus at any moment.  Suppressed sexuality in church.  Utopia: heaven
