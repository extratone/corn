# Isaac's Letter to Gabriela

Gabriela,

We are beginning something bigger than ourselves here.  You must realize the challenges our family faces... And that's just it.  You're my family, I love you.  It enrages me to see you wither away without any ambition.  Living in the world of the English, (and it is a completely different world,) I have discovered how absolutely powerful their ambition is.  It is the foundation..the _meaning_ even of their lives, and the only protection against their ambition is an ambition of your own.  You may not feel threatened by them now...but the free land is disappearing, Gabriela, and the buffer between our conflicting societies will disappear with it.
