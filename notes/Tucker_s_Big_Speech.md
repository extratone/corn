# Tucker's Big Speech

I see the skepticism on your faces, my friends.  I know you begin to doubt, and why not?  These acts we commit..this violence, what is it for?  I haven't made it clear, have I?  Have I not communicated adequately the tremendous importance of this task we have before us?

This species we are part of...this community.  Long has it struggled to be free of its doubters.  We've faced critics and questioners and leeches and bygone lost souls.  There have been campaigns of violence against our core sort, cultural pillaging, and loose-mouthed "thinkers" with endless empty points to make and lightweight citizens to sway.

We have, as a family, faced this all for hundreds of years.  Of course, we carry the conflicts and privileges of our fathers in our bones if not in our worldly stature. And what have we made with this life?  We've created technical marvels, reduced the average suffering of the species significantly, and constructed a safe, assured, and well-established system of behaviors and actions.  We know, for instance, what a 6 year old of a specific class and race should say, how it should dress, and how it should interpret and rationalize the inputs it's faced with in daily life.

Consider for a moment the human factor in all of this progression.  Think about the millions of devoted workers who've spent their lives furthering the family's quality of life.  Hold their faces in your mind.  Now compile them into one manifestation, one body.  Now imagine a dangerous and radical faction that would reject the standards upon which this worker's precious life has spent in toil to fulfill. 

Can you imagine, my friends, a parent that would claim to love its child, yet discourage their education?

Can you imagine a group of "humans" that would reject the miracle of modern hygiene and cling to a medieval regimen of _annual_ bathing? 

Can you imagine such a prehistoric, unevolved _thing_ calling itself one of us...and yet refusing the benefits of our enlightening communication apparatus?  The goal we have worked so long and so hard to achieve.

I cannot imagine such an abomination, and yet I must face it daily.  They call themselves "Amish," and they and their ideals are the last true threat to the unity of humanity.

Arrogance.  I have seen none like this.  Their primitive communities are bound with it.  _How dare they_ reject what we have built!  What right do they have to their own cultist practices?!  It is not natural to be so separate; it is not natural to rejoice in such isolation.

I do not fret, however, as I know they will soon be gone.  I know because I see genuine morality in your faces.  You are all just creatures, and the just will always prevail.

We must work, however, to keep ourselves on task.  We cannot stray.  What a truly worthy motivation though, the fate of all mankind!

Look around you - tell me what you see. This. All of this. (arm sweeps the room.)

(pause)

This is the product of man's mind.  The thinking men - the real men - THEY are the ones that built this world for you. 

Some of you can count yourselves among them.  Others...not so much. But we all work for them. We all must trust them, or look reality in the face and turn to savages again.

These men stand at the head of the pack, shining bright, illuminating what's to come like the headlight of a train locomotive. 

I may not be one of them, but my job - here - is to speak for them.

(pointing)

And for you, they have a directive:

First, stay young! Stay focused.

Our species is but one small hesitation away from taking its biggest step. By far, its biggest step. Our job is to remove that last hesitation.  Each one of you will bear witness to a whole new renaissance of thought.  And you should feel privileged!  

We're about to evolve; we're about to transcend ourselves.  You are - quite literally - the luckiest people who've ever lived.
