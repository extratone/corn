# Children of the Corn 30

The world's largest biochem corporation employs an elite assassin and his team of young computer scientists to wage war on the Amish.

-rent stuff from that one place where Amy's metal detector

-Monsanto brings out Tucker (the "secret weapon") because the green movement is gaining too much ground.  Tucker convinces them that the Amish pose a direct and fundamental philosophical threat to the future of the company, and that they must be eradicated.

-Isaac's going to Law school, coming back to his town to find it ravaged by Adderall-using compsci hipsters and robitussiun-addicted welders

**IDEA:** Tucker maybe hires a social psychologist as contractor like Drake is except to handle the aftermath of the purification...culturally conditioning the populace to forget the Amish ever existed...maybe in a sequel?

Tucker to Monsanto execs: "If we're going to do this, the sooner the better.  As the net (and the darknet) expands, the mess becomes larger and larger.  The traces of the Amish duplicate and become more and more difficult to remove."

SPRAYPAINTING CODE ON AMISH STUFF

**What does the character want?**

**Isaac**

Burnt

(20 years old), in law school but his amish faith

suit + bigass amish hat (get sombrero if no Amish hat can be found, flatten rim and paint black)

"Um"

"not bound to the suit and tie"

acts on whim

anarchist lawyer

girly eurobeat

para para paradise

(eurobeat and horrorcore?)

impulsive

Isaac is willing to compromise the core principles of his Amish faith for the eventual goal of Amish supremacy (in which case, all technology used to attain this would be destroyed and rejected.)

Isaac thinks he is using Tucker's interest in modernizing the Amish (which is just a cover-up for his plot to destroy them) for his own ends (Amish supremacy,) but is (at least in the beginning of the film) fooled by Tucker's facade.

**the amish are oppressed, they don't realize it.  "Check your English privilege"  Even though the Amish people don't feel oppressed or feel like the non-amish even effect them at all, Isaac is on a crusade to convince them that they are.**

**Tucker**

(20 years old)

Pro-monsanto kills crops welder

"Complex machine to starve them out"

so much robitussun "I should be dead"

Listens to noise tapes....uses it to relax

Robitussin sniff scene

"One locust can destroy an entire field in 2 days"

TUCKER IS THE MAIN CHARACTER

The film is written so that we try to make the audience sympathize with Tucker...yet he's a psychopathic power-hungry murderer.

TUCKER'S VARIOUS DECALOGUE TYPES

To Isaac - wants to modernize the amish and assimilate them to the rest of society

To Monsanto and the CPA - wants to eradicate the amish and with it any possibility of a profit loss / but also takes it further in "the big speech" and names the Amish as the last surviving threat to the unity of humanity.

**Drake**

(russley)

35 years old

Teacher/something at college

-needs to be a scene where he flips on students

-Pictures of motherboards in his wallet

**Don Hawkins**

FBI agent

(Kaleb)

KALEB NEEDS TO BE CREDITED AS ALAN RUCK

-Has good intentions toward the Amish...but is fought by FBI superiors (who are being paid off by Monsanto.)

**Gabriela**

(Kailin)

Isaac's sister

wooden block phone

-Speaks in extremely proper english (no contractions)

**For Teaser:** Kailin as a newsreader reading fake news article about Amish hatecrimes

**Phil Mallard** - CPA field agent.  Shot in the head in scene 3 by Tucker to demonstrate his seriousness.

**Joseph Bowes** - Older Amish gentleman.  A respected figure in the Amish community.  He's the second most politically-interested Amish individual (behind Isaac.)

Monsanto's Inside Man

Joseph has been selling information about the Amish to Monsanto for years. After a second conversation between Isaac and Tucker, Joseph prepares to warn Isaac about Tucker's possible lies, but Tucker kills him before he has the chance in the field next to the big tree.  This is the first Amish man to die at the hand of Tucker's special seed-gun weapon.  Before, Tucker had disguised his Amish kills as hatecrimes.  Joseph, though, is left lying in the field with a huge hole in his torso.  This signifies the beginning of the true all-out war on the Amish waged by Monsanto.

**Outline**

**Scene 1 - Broadway Diner - Night**

Tucker begins with a really far-fetched metaphor comparing locusts with the amish people's struggle.  "Locusts can carry 3 million times their body weight in grams"

Isaac and Tucker leave the diner and part ways, Tucker goes to his truck, Isaac goes off camera.  The into credit music starts as Tucker drives back to the secret headquarters in his truck.

**Scene 2 - CPA (Cyber Purification Agency [pronounced "spa"]) - Night (after drive from Diner)**

Tucker's behavior has completely changed.  Stoic, cold, plotting.  DRAKE is introduced.

"Plowed him, all we gotta do now is plant the seeds."

-Short scene, not too much exposed.

**Scene 3 - COLUMBIA DOWNTOWN - DAY**

Isaac calls his sister (Gabriela) on his iphone, scene transitions to her home, she answers on wood block phone.

"What it do"

Isaac is coming home from out of state...talking to his sis like what it do

**Scene?1 - CPA - TIME UNKNOWN**

Compsci students return to the CPA and Drake programs them to go back out and terrorize the Amish community

**Scene?2 - SOMEWHERE IN AMISH LAND - TIME UNDETERMINED**

Isaac is having dinner with his Amish family to showcase how FUCKING DISCONNECTED he is with his family....food is weird though like Korean and taco bell tacos with the taco bell bags still there but the bags are like from 1997.

**Scene?3 - Monsanto Scene**

After Tucker kills Phil Mallard...he makes a cup of coffee, gets a call.  In the midst of the call, goes to Phil's corpse in the corner, takes his keys, then drives his mercury mariner to st. louis

**Scene?4 - Tucker's Great Philosophical Speech**

At some point (perhaps some of the men under Tucker are starting to doubt the Amish genocide,) Tucker needs to give a long Galt-like speech detailing the problems with the Amish.  In reality, he doesn't really care enough about "humanity" or social ideas enough to have this opinion, but essentially, he claims that the Amish's refusal to participate in society makes them a dangerous threat to the future of mankind.  He rules them to be outliers..."no individual that is so removed from our well-defined and established system of social hierarchies or one that could sustain such an existence should remain alive."

The Amish are "too extreme" and "arrogant to think that they could just refuse to participate in the agenda of the rest of humanity."

"If these people make the choice to ignore the common goals of the rest of humanity...how can they be human?  If THESE PEOPLE can existence in such a deviate state from the status quo, are they not sick?  Are they not on the same moral ground as a serial killer or a genocidal dictator?  No, _these people_ are not _people_ at all, they're animals.  And what do we do to pests?  Do we let them gnaw at the foundation of the society we have built when a cheap and effective method of their eradication is available?! No!  We eradicate them!"

**Scene?5 - Isaac Cleans Out the CPA**

-Lights are off in the CPA, we see a silhouette silently killing one agent after another, eventually the lights come on and the entire room is just one bloody / gore mess.  They're all unimportant.  All in cubicles.  It's Isaac doing the killing but we don't know that.

-After the lights come on, there's only one man left, camera zooms in on gore mess for a few seconds, shows the variety of methods Isaac used to kill everyone, then we clearly see Isaac sneaking up behind this terrified / frozen man.  We don't actually see Isaac kill him though.

These people in the cubicles could be minions of Drake's...this place is almost like a hatchery for compsci majors.

**Scene?6 - Tucker Shit Cop**

Tucker is driving along...perhaps obviously going above the speed limit??? when sirens are heard and "blues + twos" are seen in his rear view mirror.

Tucker knows he's going to get a ticket, but he calculates that the cost of replacing his pants and cleaning up the car would be less than that of a speeding ticket, so he shits his pants (literally.)

When the officer approaches the window, he can obviously smell the shit and Tucker says something like "I'm sorry officer...I had to use the restroom really bad" and the cop says something like "wow, you _did_ really shit your pants, didn't you?"

NEW IDEA

Monsanto meeting scene with round table...tucker discussing the operation with monsanto execs...they're scared of him...intercuts with Isaac family scene, also around similarly shaped table, and his family is disconnected.

**Scene?7 - 30 minute confession**

Voice recorder confession, Isaac gets it from Tucker, but they have to scroll through all the shuffling and waiting because digital voice recorders are shit.

**Scene?8 - Family Man **

-Doesn't have to necessarily be relevant to the plot, just Don spewing shit over the phone to his wife/kids.
