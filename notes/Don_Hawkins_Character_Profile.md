# Don Hawkins Character Profile

`Character Concept``Children of the Corn 30``Character`

Played by Kaleb Martin DANGEROUSLY SEXY

FBI agent 

In his 30s. I'm thinking that's about as old as Kaleb could possibly be taken for.

KALEB NEEDS TO BE CREDITED AS ALAN RUCK

-Has good intentions toward the Amish...but is fought by FBI superiors (who are being paid off by Monsanto.)

**Inspired by/Stolen from:**

-Leroy Jethro Gibbs (NCIS)

From Gibbs comes his military mindset, attitude, and sense of duty and honor, except he's even more the cliche salty patriotic american suit-wearing hero in that he had a fairly good relationship with his father (better than Gibbs anyway,) and is in a relatively "successful" marriage.  The interesting thing about Don is his early-onset saltiness.

Whereas Gibbs is in his 50s in NCIS and has that post-human relationships attitude, Hawkins is young, but equally serene.  

Gibbs is also the head of a department, but Hawkins is a "lone wolf" when it comes to work.  He's isolated from, (but still highly respected by) the individuals he works with in the FBI.  He still works for somebody...it's still the first half of his career, but he acts like he's at retirement age.

**What does Don want? **

Children/family, make the world a little safer. Don's Utopia: America, with a little less violence 

-Don is likable, moderate.  He wants the world to be "just a little more reasonable."

-Don is the kinda guy who generally thinks "people need more common sense."

This is Don's public profile, but he is actually quite intelligent.

Don was the "anything goes" kinda guy in his youth.  Now, he's less open minded, but only reacts to concepts he doesn't understand with confusion, not anger.

(I.E. Don would probably lean towards the right with his fundamental belief in the family as the foundation of American life, but he wouldn't have a personal problem with the Christian controversial topics ((gay marriage, drugs, abortion.)))

Don has an inherent respect for anything old and American...he lives internally in the 60s.

Don believes the 60s American Dream is the best path a man could follow...but he generally isn't bothered by people who deviate from his ideas. 

Don was the youngest of three kids.  He grew up in Northern Illinois...hunted deer with his dad at 8 years old.

-Has that salty federal agent vibe...concealed emotions, very tactical dude, with a deep-rooted sense of military behavior and a sense of honor.

-Don is the kind of guy that resolves a conflict with a handshake. (A man's man, if you will.)

-Reads the Wall Street Journal

**DON'S POSITION ON AMISH HATECRIMES**

Don loves America, and he see's the Amish as integral to the American landscape.  He's "in it" to preserve American values, and he identifies with the hard-working nature of the Amish people.  Of course, Don would defend any American citizen...his oaths to the country are a matter of honor to him...but has a special interest in the wellbeing of the Amish because of his rural upbringing.
