# 2-13-2014 Audio Notes Transcription

-Wendyvainity-A skyscraper is moved in on a vehicle resembling the saturn V rocket transporter into a secluded amish community. Afterwards, a torrent of fleet cars drive down the Amish streets right into the skyscraper.  The Amish feel as if an alien mothership has landed. Apocalyptic.

-After Tucker's speech, a scene where Drake is programming the college kids.

-"They forget their childhood; they're a whole new human now, and they have nothing but contempt for the Amish."

-After they are programmed, they "just walk out and start terrorizing the Amish community" with the pace of a businessman walking through the mall toward the Fendi store.

-The salad colanders will remain on their heads.

-Salad colanders have RAM chips taped to them.

-50s scifi

-A really large antenna on the salad colander as well

-Car CB radio antenna

-Actors will be paid to walk through downtown Columbia wearing these accessories. (in the film, they are walking through downtown towards the amish community.)

-When the CPA agents actually ARRIVE in the Amish community "some real shit" happens. "Scene straight out of an exploitation film."

"Some little Amish person is walking along when they suddenly get pushed down by colander agents."

"[The agents] whip out their smartphones and open up the flashlight app."

"They're just flashing this light and the Amish don't know what this is" ....they're screaming

They're kicked around before having their brains fried by the smartphones.

On the screen, there's an app that has a slider beneath text that says "MICROWAVE EMISSIONS" On screen, we see an agent slide the slider all the way to the right, through a zone that says "LETHAL." Afterwards, the effect of a watermelon exploding (as the individual's head.)

-"A giant projector screen with TED talks" (to terrify the Amish.) Projects on to their farmhouse (also playing YouTube videos) while agents spraypaint raw code on farmhouse/something. **where does the code come from? rusk should pick it**

**-**Drake could be recruiting these people from college campuses.

-The CPA agents pour cough syrup into a cup and mix in sprinkles of pills, then force feed it to an Amish person.

"Some old amish person having an existential crises right there."

-5 minutes of Amish horror

-"More tormenting than killing."

-What's Agent Hawkins going to do about this?

-He'd have to arrive on scene in his car...it terrifies them too.

-He arrives and starts defending them...calls for backup but the FBI has abandoned him.

-He's got a pistol and 2 magazines of ammo, one shotgun in the trunk of his car.

-In his defense of the Amish, given his limited ammo supply, he has to fist fight groups of CPA agents, injecting elements of a traditional military thriller into the movie. The Bourne Movies.

-But then he stumbles upon AN ARSENAL of weapons somehow in this amish community.

-Before this....a scene where he is backed into a corner in a barn with a bunch of amish people behind him, they're terrified. But somehow he gets out of this. "Goes akimbo" *looks over and sees the arsenal mentioned above* he's like "alright" and mows them down.

-The Amish survive this "battle" but they are severely weakened. 

-So this battle is separate from "the big finale" battle.

-What happens in between?

-Brent suggests that they blend together.

-Note that above, the CPA agents don't have guns, so agent hawkins is essentially just slaughtering them.

-"one of them has just been brutally murdered. His intestines have been taking out of his stomach and used to hang him in the middle of a generator."

-Brent suggests that we see Isaac change sort of, and then disappear for a bit in the film, then "Isaac Cleans out the CPA"

-"the scene right after Tucker shoots at Isaac, we see him change"

-so after tucker shoots at isaac, he goes back to the CPA, shoots up roundup to recover from the GMO-free food, delivers his crazy long speech and that speech is just SO FUCKING LONG that is really just SEEMS Isaac has been gone for a long time

and then the colander heads come in...we see the 10 minutes or whatever of amish destruction

And then the CPA base clean out.....and Isaac is revealed to be responsible for it right at the end

"Scene ?5 comes later, everything after Scene?5 is Isaac's rage"

-Idea for the huge final battle between Tucker and Isaac: tucker is in a combine, coming at Isaac with the reel turning but somehow the combine comes to an abrupt halt, Tucker flies out of the windshield. We're led to believe by the camera angle that he's going to fall into the reel of his own combine but actually just falls on a pitchfork that Isaac is holding and that is where he dies. Even if the combine isn't involved, Tucker should die by falling on a pitchfork.

-Brent proposes a dead leaves- like gun battle between tucker and Issac.

-Don is in the way of Isaac and he ends up dying...his death is not justified to the audience. Dies out of focus.  Only in the frame/focus enough for you to realize who it is. "The way the shot is done, you're forced to not care about Don's death."  We never see him again.

-DON COULD DIE IN THE MIDDLE OF THE TUCKER-ISAAC FIGHT

"The end of the movie.....as Isaac kills the last CPA agent, he turns around to face his people, who he has been protecting, and they are disgusted by him." Isaac stands in confusion for a second before pointing a gun at Gabriela (who's standing in the crowd,) and it immediately cuts to black. (We don't hear any gunshots or anything)
