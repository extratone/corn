# Ideas for Don Hawkins scenes - 1-9-2014

Just generally video of him driving would be good.

-Shot of Don smoking a cigar on top of a parking garage over an empty downtown Columbia.

-Shot of Don walking along the lit hallways of some university building.

-Write up a "chance encounter" scene with Tucker where they meet up somewhere and Don recognizes Tucker from Don's first time tracking down Isaac. Â (Tucker was with Isaac but didn't say anything, Don has yet to connect the crimes against the Amish with Monsanto.)

They could meet up on a well-lit sports field....
