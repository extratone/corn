# Isaac - Character Profile

`Character Concept``Children of the Corn 30``Character``Character Profile`

Isaac is willing to compromise the core principles of his Amish faith for the eventual goal of Amish supremacy (in which case, all technology used to attain this would be destroyed and rejected.) 

Isaac thinks he is using Tucker's interest in modernizing the Amish (which is just a cover-up for his plot to destroy them) for his own ends (Amish supremacy,) but is (at least in the beginning of the film) fooled by Tucker's facade. 

**the amish are oppressed, they don't realize it.  "Check your English privilege"  Even though the Amish people don't feel oppressed or feel like the non-amish even effect them at all, Isaac is on a crusade to convince them that they are.**
