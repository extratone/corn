# Tucker - Character Profile

`Children of the Corn 30``Character``Tucker`

Played by David Blue

Primary Occupation: Monsanto "secret weapon."  Assassin, engineer, 

Tucker's chosen disguise is a hard-working, blue collar American just trying to do a good job and raise a good family.  He maintains this facade with his clothes (workshirts, jeans.)

In reality though, Tucker is only operating under this disguise because it's what's needed to gain him power in his current situation.  His camouflage subtly changes with the scenery.  (Maybe wear a sportcoat in St. Louis?)

-Scene idea: a scene where Tucker doesn't yawn even though he's in the midst of like a weird amount of people yawning.
