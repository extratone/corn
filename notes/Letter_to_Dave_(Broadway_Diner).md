# Letter to Dave (Broadway Diner)

Dave,

We spoke on Friday about shooting for our film at the Diner. Essentially, we just need shots at night, without any customers. Â We have a limited budget but we will compensate any employee(s) that are required to be present and we'd also like to give you something for the use of the building. At most, we'll need 2 hours, but it should be significantly less.

In general, I need to schedule at least two weeks in advance, and our deadline is the end of May, so the most convenient time/day in that range for you is good for us.

Thanks!

David Blue
